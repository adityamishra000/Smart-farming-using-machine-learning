# Smart-farming-using-machine-learning
I develop this smart farming project using machine learning to see the website visit http://imadityamishra.me
1. Introduction
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability. By utilizing various sensors, satellite imagery, and other data sources, we develop predictive models and optimization algorithms to enhance farming practices such as irrigation management, pest control, crop yield prediction, and soil health monitoring.
